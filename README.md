# Machine-learning
This repository will contain all the stuffs required for beginners in ML do follow and star this repo for regular updates 

This repo contains data preprocessing steps need to be known by begineers


For every ML beginner python is recommended ,this repo is full of ML python algorithm.


Python packages used : numpy,pandas,matploit,sklearn,statsmodels........continues will be added more.
# Regression
1) In linear regression we have used a dataset containing details of employee salary and years of experience using this model we can predict the salary of employee by years of experince.

2) In multiple linear regression we have used dataset containing details of expenditure of startups and their profit using this model we can predict the profit of startup ,and also we have developed a model using backward elimination technique.

3) In polynomial linear regression we have used dataset containing details of salary and years of experience ,this could be useful for HR dept. to detect the if the new joinee employee is giving right info about his/her salary.

4) In SVR linear regression we have used dataset containing details of salary and years of experience ,this could be useful for HR dept. to detect the if the new joinee employee is giving right info about his/her salary.

5) In Decision Tree regression we have used dataset containing details of salary and years of experience ,this could be useful for HR dept. to detect the if the new joinee employee is giving right info about his/her salary.

6) In Random Forest regression we have used dataset containing details of salary and years of experience ,this could be useful for HR dept. to detect the if the new joinee employee is giving right info about his/her salary.this algorithm gives the best result better than polynomial regression.
# Classification
1) In logistic regression we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .

2) In Knn regression we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .

3) In SVN regression we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .

4) In Random Forest regression we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .

5) In Decision Tree regression we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .

6) In kernel SVM we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .Kernel SVM is mostly used for complicated dataset where data is not linearly separable.

6) In Naives bayes one of the most imp classification algorithm here we have used a dataset containing details of  salary ,age and product buyed using this model we can predict the whether the customer of certain age and salary will buy the product or not .Naive bayes works on bayes probability theorem , before getting into coding one have to understand how the formulae works for classifiying which group the point belongs to.
