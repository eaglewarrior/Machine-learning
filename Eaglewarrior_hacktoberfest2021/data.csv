"awesome sound quality. pros 7-8 hrs of battery life (including 45 mins approx call time)Awesome sound output. Bass and treble are really very clear without equaliser. With equaliser, sound wary depends on the handset sound quality.Weightless to carry and in head tooMic is good, but in traffic it is not too good (3.25/5)3.5mm Option is really important to mention.

"Sound clarity and bass is above average. Loved it. But the most irritating thing is that it's not comfortable at all. It holds both of our earpieces like a hell. Not recommended for gaming. Even though I'm a hard gamer. It cannot be used for more than 15mins (hardly). AUX is perfectly fine, no issue with that but the bluetooth connectivity also irritating me at some points. While using through bt, it produces some awkward sounds when we pause--play--pause-play a  video. First' I thought it's...READ MORE",3

Hi guys I recently brought these headphone and have been using it for a while now. The headphones are just decent for the price range. I got it for under 1000 bucks. The optimal sound can be achieved through equilizer only. Pairing it is fairly easy. Battery is also decent. The ear puffs are not too comfortable. A little bigger and softer puffs would have been great. The build quality is also fairly decent. The only issue I faced was with the microphone. Others were not able to hear me proper...READ MORE,3

Bought this headphone on 16 June 2020. It's been a few days I've been using it. So far the battery backup is superb in this price segment. While the sound and bass is crystal clear and the noise cancellation works very well. A small complaint is regarding the design. After wearing it for an hour the ears stars paining due to small ears caps and tight build. Overall a good product for people who can comprise on the ear pain.READ MORE,4

Writing this review after 9 days of usage:-The sound quality is rich and impressive along with the bass that makes you feel that you are in the music. Noise cancellation is also great. Battery backup is excellent. Although I found little discomfort in the ears after 1hr or 2hr of continuous usage because the headset is a little tight. Overall a great headphone to consider at this price range. Great job done by Boat and thanks to flipkart.READ MORE,5

"Well after using it for 6 months now, Its worth in Rs 999. Sound quality is pretty good, looks are also good. Although it was a bit tight on ears initially but now i would say it has loosened up to fit the comfort level. It's sound is actually good. But Bluetooth range is bad, it looses connection once u get out of room and mic also doesn't work properly sometimes. But if you are getting it for INR 1000 should go for it. Although can compare it with mivi headphones.READ MORE",4

Its an awesome product. I used it for 10 days... and i charged it for just 3 times till now.

I strongly recommend it.READ MORE,5

Review after using it for a while-1. Sound Quality- 3/5Not the best sound at this price point. I'm an audiophile & a music producer so I've tried lots of headphones. Sounds are a bit muffled. Low frequencies are boosted so better base. Mid are boosted a little so voice parts are loud. But higher frequencies are very low. Unless you use an equilizer you might not get the best experience. Mic is also average. Capturing strength isn't that great. You might have to shout while talking. Compared...READ MORE,3

Good Head Phone with better sound quality and built design is so simple and comfortable to use but I feel that if they provided separate buttons for volume up /down and next/previous and make multifunction button into separate button.

"I am satisfied with this purchase. I  made up my mind to buy it after testing it personally and taking feedback from two of my collegues. Sound quality and bass is commendable at the price Rs999 I bought it for. The connectivity range of Bluetooth with the headphones as per my test was about 8m and beyond it you begin to feel the distortions. The two draw backs I found in my headphones were : 1. Pads could be softer ; 2. Slight scratchy sound are heard while speaking to someone, though the mo...READ MORE",4

I am here by using the product for three months. I have a good experience  with this product. Sound is excellent. It takes no time to connect with bluetooth. Design is also very cool.

"okk i have been using these for almost 5 months now and here is my review for these headphones :-                 Superb sound quality, Bass is osm, minimal design, a little tight for sometime but adjusts after a week or so..,minimal controler keys, soft cushions,nice battery backup,decent charging  speed, i didnt find the mic that good but overall its a beast in this proce rangeREAD MORE",4
even though it is little tight on your head it provide super bass and clarity . very good backup. over all fabulous productREAD MORE,5
I am writing this review after 1 week of usage.The product is good for first time users. Sounds is good and built quality is okay. If you are thinking to play PUBG then you won't be able to play. The Bluetooth lags while playing. You can play the game using aux cable. I bought for 1500.The headphones are tight and need to be adjusted after every 20 to 30 mins. At last it is good for normal usage.READ MORE,4
"Nice headphones in budget. The sound quality and bass is superb and is design is also very impressive. But the only thing which should be noted down that these headphones are really fit on ears. When you hear songs for half and hour, you feel pain in your ear. Because of that pain, mood goes off. This thing should be fixed. After all, these headphones are good 🎧🎧👍READ MORE",4

"Headphone ear cup pads are not that much comfortable. It is made of fine quality. Ears starts to sweat and pain when used for longer period of time. Other issue, microphone doesn't work when connected to bluetooth, for that you need to disconnect it first and then plug wire to use it(mic) like when you are receiving calls which is really disturbing! Best alternative to this is Moto Pulse which I have used, most of the things between both are of same quality but Moto is more comfortable.READ MORE",3

Packaging was good. As usual ontime delivery by Flipkart. Regarding the product it's best out there in the market for its price. The only Con is ears start to pain after an hour or so. The cushion on the earpods is good. The build quality is topnotch for the price point. It comes with 3.5mm audio jack as well. In case you run out of battery you can always rely on the conventional wire setup and continue your journey of listening to music :) Over all a great product for 1.4k.READ MORE,4

Moreover, its wireless range from the phone is very low, It claims 10 m range but I don't find this claim right.

"First I repent that I could not buy the boat 225bt earphones at ₹1099, but bought it on the 2nd day of BBD sale. Got it at ₹900   including the discount. And coming to the part of reviewing the headphones, I must be really honest with you guys. If you compare it with the JBLs and Seinheiser headphones that cost like 2-3 times of boats is unfair. My review stays with what I paid for..It's the best budget headphones that you could get in India right now and with the price I got it was a steal...READ MORE",5

Better is not to use it.2) One cannot listen to music for 2-3hours as the Headbuds will start hurting the ears due to compression.READ MORE",4
"I bought these effectively around Rs 899, and believe me these are better than other headphones which come under Rs 2000. Noise cancellation is better than others. Bass is awesome. Tremple could have been better, but strong bass makes up for that. Go for it.READ MORE",5

"The product is quite nice, music quality is fine with some bass. Call quality is decent, the person on the line was able to listen to me if i spoke in a little raised voice.Use for long duration was somewhat uncomfortable.

Products build quality is just average. Particularly speaking the audio out put is not great. Its just average. Dont even think about those highs and lows. Its not pleasent to listen.u cant use this device more than half an hour. In my opinion save some more bucks and buy a better one. Though the connectivity is very fast. Even the ear pads are very small. U wont get a comfortable feel if u have big ears. Finally.  Less price is not giving a good product. So better buy a costly one.READ MORE,3

"I shouldn't have given any ratings. But, for sound quality, I'm giving 1 star.Ears are starting to hurt after 10 minutes of usage. Poor build quality. And the most important problem is calling through Bluetooth. When, you will call through this headphone, the opposite person couldn't hear you properly after 5 mins. I have checked it so many times. It is the main issue. They are not giving me refund. I have replaced the product once but the problem not fixed. Very disappointed.READ MORE",1

Go for it blindly. The sound quality will mesmerize you. Dont go by the naysayers. Those complaining about the tightness have probably never used a headphone before. It is bound to be a little tight else it will fall off your head. Regarding the sound clarity it is clear and crisp. The bass is thumpingly good. What else do you expect in 999?READ MORE,5

They produce continuous cracked beep sound when used on Bluetooth on low volume or when there is drops in the songs.Headphones are good but are little tight on ears and can become uncomfortable if used for long period of time.

"Bought the product to attend the online classes. Within 2 months, one side stopped working, but that was taken care by the Boat company n was rectified. The major issue with the headset is the MIC. I cant walk n talk, as the other person wont hear my voice, i need to hold my phone and use the MIC of the phone only than the other person is able to hear me. For me, this ends the concept of Bluetooth headset, if i am unable to use the headset without holding the phone..READ MORE",2

But obviously they are not the most comfortable pair of headphones too. Bass is good. Sound not very clear. But good for the price. Though I expected a bit better. Battery and build satisfactory. As my first concern is sound always. Not gonna buy them for 1499 for sure. Got them for 1099. Happy... .READ MORE,4

"LONG TERM REVIEW:The headphone is quite good the only problem with the headset is the fitting of the headphones , it can be felt while wearing for more than 25 minutes.The sound quality is good and ok for this price range but please purchase this If you are a bass lover,there is no particular button for Google assistant therefore you can check over other wireless earphones .DON'T BUY THIS HEADPHONES FOR MIC , YOU CAN'T EVEN SPEAK A PHONE CALL AS THIS MIC DETECTS ALL THE SOUND AVAILABLE IT'...READ MORE",4

"I'm writing the review after using it for an year (pictures too). Cons: 1. Tight on ears, special for those who wear glasses. Causes a little discomfort if used for an hour or half. Pros: 1. Sound quality is good, it's still the same as I bought it.2. Build quality is good too, nothing changed in an year. To sum up, go for it if comfort isn't the priority. And eyeglass wearers, Please Don't!!!READ MORE",4

The headset is just awesome but feels very tight when used for more then 30 to 45 mins. The battery backup is the best part in it. Design is also great. But when it comes for comfort then it's very underrated. Dont just buy by looking at the number of reviews and it's overall stars. The product is not worth Rs500 even..READ MORE,2
This headphone is good but not comfortable and it's price rate is high and also the body of this headphone is very weak........😊😊READ MORE,3

"The sound quality couldn't be more better. The only problem is that when u are not using the audio jack, the noise cancelling mic won't work rather it will increase the noise and the other person would barely be able to listen to your voice. Else than this, the product is awesome.READ MORE",5
Whenever connected to bluetooth and when calls are received the receipt is not able to hear my voice clearly and there is a lot of disturbance in the background which does not allow me to take the calls via Bluetooth. I have to disconnect the bluetooth everytime to take normal calls. Though the bass is really good while watching movies and listening to music but I don't recommend to take calls with it.READ MORE,2

The product is good if you get it for 1000 or less. Not worth more than that. Battery will be good at start but till time progresses it will require frequent charging. If you have more money don't buy it. Bit if you less money from parents then go for it. Somehow fits in budget.READ MORE,3

"This is an honest review for these headphonesSound quality is the best in this rangeIt is equalised which means that the treble comes as good as the bass in these headphonesIt fits perfectly on your ears, it is very comfortableThe padding on these headphones is top notch in the earcups and in the headIt comes with a micro usb cable and charges fast to provide a long battery lifeIt can also be used with the aux cable but while using the aux cable the sound quality falls very behind The ...READ MORE",5

The headset provides the best bass experience in it's budget range (INR 999/-) and the battery backup is top notch as wellThe cons would be the poor quality of in-built microphone and its build quality which diminishes its charm after a few prolonged hours of use. So these headphones aren't much suitable for a heavy gaming profile but do offer the best quality bass experience (sound quality is normal).READ MORE,4

Honest Review:I bought it for 1399/- and loved it as it looks premium and easy to carry since it's foldable. I Love the Quality Of sound it produces. But it hurts my ears as it too tight initially (might get elastic with time). The bass and music quality is excellent and i feel it is the best under 1.5k rupees.For Initial impression Check my YouTube chanel @TechTalksREAD MORE,4

"It's a good product, not the best but still not bad as well. The bluetooth version written inside the package delivered is v2.1. Battery backup is fair. Body is complete plastic. Feels little delicate. Bass is not as expected, you'd rather use an equalizer. Dimension of the outer body of speaker unit is 7cm diameter. Cables work good.READ MORE",4
"3.5mm pins are not of good quality. When we connect wire to headset and mobile there is some diaturbance in the audio. First time when i connected bluetooth to mobile there was a break in the voice. From second and third time onwards it is good, otherwise i thought to return the product. I purchased 2nos of headsets both had the same issue. The range is very less hardly 5 feet which is very disappointing.READ MORE",3

"It has awesome sound quality with great bass!!! All good, but the greatest flaw in design. It appears very good and attractive, the problem is we cannot keep it on head for long. It's very rigid on the ears, it's like constant pressure on ears. Just feel like removing within few minutes. The reason is they designed such a way that we cannot adjust the headset from top, but only on ears, this leaves no room for relaxation on ears. Even when you look at the design it's completely deep arc shape...READ MORE",2

It's sound & bass is good but in terms of functionality it has none! For example:1. Your boAt Rockerz 400 are paired  up with two devices both have Bluetooth on. Both will try to connect and you cannot disconnect them via your headphones. So if the other device is paired up then you have to turn off the Bluetooth in that so that you can connect it to the desired one.2. Double tapping the play-pause button dials to the recent contact.3. Cannot use assistant with these earphones.4. 3 pin AU...READ MORE,3

Was looking for a something to complement my jbl t450 and I was interested in boat due to its offer price of 1k. We can break the review into multiple parts.1) Sound quality (3/5): Loud and bassy but poor low and mids. Compared to competition it really lacks quality of music and relies more on Bass and loudness........2) Build Quality (4/5): It's lightweight and well built padding are of cloth material which improves life even if comfort is low. They could have improved the buttons which lo...READ MORE,3

Lacks deep bass and average noice cancellation but sound is good. Also earcup is small and is little tight hence it will be a little iritation for long hour use.I'm disappointed with bass of rockers 400. Overall the product is good. Worth for Rs 964/- since it is Bluetooth device.But I'm fond of deep bass hence Rockez 400 is a slight disappointment for me.READ MORE,4

"Honestly I like it but it could be better or the best if the sound was more and the ear cushions were a bit big,rather than that it's Good, The bass is nice, ear cushions are soft and are rotatable,and you can keep the upper portion on your neck and rotate the cushions, in that way you won't have any ear pain. The battery backuo is also good. But It's not for pro gamers, but average gamers can use it easily; probably it's best for average gamers.👍READ MORE",2

This is a worthy purchaseREAD MORE,5
It is a pretty good headphone. Awesome bass and sound quality... The only issue I have with it it it is a bit tight owing to its small ear pad size. Rest it's just awesome. Completely recommended. It's folding build makes it very easy to carry even within a short amount of space. Flexible ear pads. Another issue I have with it is sometimes the playback pause/play button doesn't work... But that doesn't count much for me. Totally recommendedREAD MORE,5

Best headphones ever.. tried the jbl live 650 bt too but being honest they are not more good than these body rockerz .. truly saying go for them without any hesitation.. they will feel you better. Pros : 1) BASS is AWESOME.2) BATTERY BACKUP is more than ENOUGH3) GREYISH GREEN COLOUR feels premium 4) LIGHT WEIGHT and feels like we are wearing none 5) NOISE CANCELLATION is also GOOD.JUST GO FOR IT . 🔥🔥READ MORE,5
